          Hey there! I'm Frankie. I've always felt somewhere in-between, 
          being culturally American yet not white enough, and too American to never quite fit in to my own Taiwanese roots. 
          I started this website as a place where I could explore my identity through food and share the recipes that 
          define me as a Taiwanese American first-gen kid.
        </p>
        <p class="intro__paragraph">
          You'll find everything from recipes passed down from my family to dishes that blend the cultural lines and 
          make my ancestors pass out (and that's okay!). I just want it to feel like you’re eating in my grandma’s 
          kitchen and getting the best kind of fat with 10 year old plump me, pork buns stuffed in the face 
          in a suburban midwestern kitchen full of steam and nostalgia.
